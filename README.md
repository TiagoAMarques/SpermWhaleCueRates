This repository contains the data and code necessary to reproduce all the results and figures in a manuscript by 
Marques et al. submitted to the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America entitled 
"Estimating sperm whale cue rates to inform passive acoustic density estimation via cue counting"

The main supplementary files result from a simplification of a considerably convoluted analysis 
and the multiple dead ends that can be found at https://github.com/TiagoAMarques/Report4BB/
